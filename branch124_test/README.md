# Nealvis' C64 Utilities
This directory holds tests for fp124 branch operations.

## Overview
All the assembler code in this directory is written for Kick Assembler and in general the setup outlined in the [main repository README.md](../README.md)

Each .asm file in this directory is a standalone c64 program that tests a subset of the fp124 branch operations.
